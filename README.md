# Maximal Clique Enumeration Algorithm given in the paper (ARBORICITY AND SUBGRAPH LISTING ALGORITHMS*) by NORISHIGE CHIBA AND TAKAO NISHIZEKVf
The algorithm CLIQUE enumerates all maximal cliques in a graph with a time complexity of O(α(G)m) per clique and O(m) space, where α(G) is the graph's arboricity (a sparsity measure) and m is the number of edges. By leveraging vertex ordering (sorted by degree) and efficient pruning via lexicographical checks, the algorithm bounds per-clique operations to a cost proportional to the graph's density and edge count. The proof establishes this using inductive analysis, showing that the time for each recursive step UPDATE(i, C) is dominated by neighborhood intersections and degree sums, while space remains linear due to optimized global variables and disjoint set management. This approach balances theoretical optimality for sparse graphs (α(G) ≈ O(1)) with practical scalability, though it retains exponential worst-case complexity for dense graphs. The method prioritizes low-degree vertices and early elimination of non-maximal cliques, ensuring efficient traversal of the search space.
