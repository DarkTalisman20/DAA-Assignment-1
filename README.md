&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project we implement three algorithms for finding all the maximal cliques in an undirected graph in C++. The algorithms are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The algorithm CLIQUE from pages 220-222 from the paper titled Arboricity and Subgraph Mining; by Norishige Chiba and Takao Nishizeki. (Link: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6241/2019sp/readings/Chiba-1985-arboricity.pdf).  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The ELS Algorithm given in the paper titled Listing All Maximal Cliques in Sparse Graphs in Near-optimal Time by David Eppstein, Maarten Loffler, and Darren Strash. (Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5440).    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The algorithm given in the paper titled The worst-case time complexity for generating all maximal cliques and computational experiments by Etsuji Tomita, Akira Tanakaa, Haruhisa Takahashi. (Link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397506003586).  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then executed these algorithms on three graph datasets:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. as-Skitter (Link: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/as-Skitter.html)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Email-Enron (Link: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Enron.html)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Wiki-Vote (Link: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Vote.html)    

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We treated these datasets as undirected graphs and applied these algorithms. The input is taken from a text file with some optional text, including number of vertices, followed by edges, and the rest of the lines denoting a pair of vertices with an edge between them. We store the graphs in adjacency list format. The results are shown in the algorithm-wise markdowns, and the report.

## Run Locally

1.Download the zip file with codes from the submission.  
2. Download the dataset zip folder from the google drive link. (Link: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16u1PDHzcSc9NJv8H8-DymsLPtUoBTNyt?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16u1PDHzcSc9NJv8H8-DymsLPtUoBTNyt?usp=sharing)).  
3. Extract the dataset .txt files from the zip folder and put them in the same folder where all the codes are.  
4. Go to the project directory.  
5. Compile the file and run it.  

For Unix/Mac:

```bash
  g++ <file-name>.cpp -o <file-name>.out
  ./<file-name>.out <dataset>.txt
```

For Windows:

```bash
  g++ .cpp -o <file-name>.exe
  ./<file-name>.exe <dataset>.txt
```

Example for ELS with Wiki-Vote we input:  
```bash
  g++ els.cpp -o els.exe
  ./els.exe Wiki-Vote.txt
```

file-name can be tomita, or els, or chiba.  
dataset can be wiki-Vote or as-skitter or email-Enron.
